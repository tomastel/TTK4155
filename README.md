# [TTK4155 - Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems Design](http://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4155)
*In collaboration with [Khuong Huynh](https://github.com/Khuongh) and [HÃ¥vard Olai Kopperstad](https://github.com/haavardok).*

This repository includes all developed software for the course.

The course's goal was to develop an embedded system for a fully functional one-player pingpong game with an [Atmel AVR ATmega162](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2513-8-bit-AVR-Microntroller-ATmega162_Datasheet.pdf).
